# You should now have access to the `vehicles` data frame
# You can use `View()` to inspect it

# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set.

# Write a function that takes a `year_choice` and a `make_choice` as parameters,

# of that make in that year.
# You'll need to filter more (and do some selecting)!
